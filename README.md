# 3D-Small-Objects-Sharing-Community
This is the source code for our course project for Software Engineering, 2023 fall. We created a simple application using React, NodeJS and MySQL. Users of this app will be able to:
- create their own 3D scene with just one single image.
- upload 3D point cloud files(.ply)
- assemble two 3D scenes into one.
- share their favorable 3D scenes with others in the community.
